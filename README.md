learn# React createElement()

## Overview

In this lesson, we'll call `React.createElement()` and also describe how we can build elements out of other React elements.

## Objectives
1. Call `React.createElement()` and describe its arguments
2. Use `ReactDOM.render()` to render an element to a page
3. Describe how we can build elements out of other React elements
4. Add child elements and nested child elements
5. Pass properties to an element

## Setting Up React

Before we start working on this, let's go through some procedural setup to get React running on your system. React has a cli tool called Create React App that allows you to bootstrap React project quickly. We will also install Webpack for the hot reload. Lets install these packages globally so that we have the necessary dependencies on our machine for the lessons and labs in the this section.

```
$ npm install -g create-react-app webpack
```

Note!! You might have to run `sudo` before npm install depending on how you set up node.

We will be using the Create React App folder structure for all of our lessons and labs, so you should feel comfortable working with this tool when you decide to build your own React Playground.

## Running The Application

We will be running our mini-React application using `npm`. From the directory of this project, in your terminal, run:

```
$ npm install && npm start
```

This should open a browser and display an empty white screen. Yay!!! We have our first React app :). Don't get too excited still much to learn and see.

## Baby steps

To kick things off, let's create a really basic page title in React using `React.createElement()`. Open up your `index.js` and let's get started.

First we need to import the React library

```js
import React from 'react';
```

and then we can create our first element

```js
const title = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'My First React Code');
```

Let's briefly talk about the arguments of `React.createElement()`.

The first one is the type of element we're creating, in this case an `<h1>` tag. This could also be another React component. If we're creating an HTML element, we pass in the name as a string, just like we did above. If we're creating a React component, we pass in the variable that the component is assigned to.

The second argument is an object containing properties ('props' in React terms) that get passed to the component. Since we're just getting started with React, we won't use these just yet â€” but be aware that the second options serves this purpose.

Finally, the last argument is the children of that component. This can be a quoted string like shown above, in which case the content will be interpreted as text. However, we can also pass in a reference to another component, allowing us to nest elements and components within each other (we'll get to that in a bit).

Now that we have our element, it's time to render it to the page. We do this using `ReactDOM.render()`. This takes two arguments: the first one being the thing we want to render (our `title` element), and the second one is a target DOM node to render things into.

First we need to import this from the React Dom library

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
```

and then we can render our React element from earlier.

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  title,
  document.getElementById('global')
);
```

The final code in `index.js` should look like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const title = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'My First React Code');

ReactDOM.render(
  title,
  document.getElementById('global')
);
```

Even though all of this could easily fit on one line, it's generally a good idea to add line breaks to your arguments for `ReactDOM.render()`. Sometimes, the element you're rendering to the page can also contain children itself. The formatting using line breaks allows us to keep our code clean.

Since we are using a build tool called Webpack (we will go into this much later in the course), you will notice that the page is reloading automatically. You should now see a screen that displays "My First React Code".

## Becoming a parent

Now that we know how to render stuff, let's make our app a little more complex by introducing child elements. We'll create an element to render our title in (let's call it a container). Remember how we added a text child in our `title` component? Now we're going to add an element as a child, so we pass it by reference instead of using a string:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const title = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'My First React Code');
const container = React.createElement('div', {}, title);

ReactDOM.render(
  container,
  document.getElementById('global')
);
```

Our `title` seems a little lonely though... Let's add a sibling! We'll create a `paragraph` element and then pass it as another child to our `container` children.

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const title = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'My First React Code');
const paragraph = React.createElement('p', {}, 'Writing some more HTML. Cool stuff!');
const container = React.createElement('div', {}, [title, paragraph]);

ReactDOM.render(
  container,
  document.getElementById('global')
);
```

Note how if we want to add multiple children, we use an _array_!

## Your children's children
We can nest children as much as we want. We also don't need to store our elements in variables before using them, we can declare them inline as well (though the downside of this is less readable code):

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const list =
  React.createElement('div', {},
    React.createElement('h1', {}, 'My favorite ice cream flavors'),
    React.createElement('ul', {},
      [
        React.createElement('li', {}, 'Chocolate'),
        React.createElement('li', {}, 'Vanilla'),
        React.createElement('li', {}, 'Banana')
      ]
    )
  );

ReactDOM.render(
  list,
  document.getElementById('global')
);
```

## Adding attributes
As mentioned before, we pass properties to an element using the second argument (an object, which we've left empty for now). Suppose we wanted to add some classes to make our ice cream flavors stand out. What would we need to add? Let's try this...

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const list =
  React.createElement('div', {},
    React.createElement('h1', {}, 'My favorite ice cream flavors'),
    React.createElement('ul', {},
      [
        React.createElement('li', { class: 'brown' }, 'Chocolate'),
        React.createElement('li', { class: 'white' }, 'Vanilla'),
        React.createElement('li', { class: 'yellow' }, 'Banana')
      ]
    )
  );

ReactDOM.render(
  list,
  document.getElementById('global')
);
```

Oops! That doesn't seem to work. If we take a look at our console, we'll see a helpful error message (ignore the error message about a `key` property, we'll get to that in another lesson):

```
Warning: Unknown DOM property class. Did you mean className?
    in li
    in ul
    in div
```

Using `className` instead will do the trick. Awesome! The prop is called `className` because `class` is a _reserved keyword_ in JavaScript. Using reserved keywords as keys in an object is something that you should never do, since this can result in unexpected behavior. Instead, React expects the `className` prop instead, if we want to add a class to our element.

Let's update our code.

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const list =
  React.createElement('div', {},
    React.createElement('h1', {}, 'My favorite ice cream flavors'),
    React.createElement('ul', {},
      [
        React.createElement('li', { className: 'brown' }, 'Chocolate'),
        React.createElement('li', { className: 'white' }, 'Vanilla'),
        React.createElement('li', { className: 'yellow' }, 'Banana')
      ]
    )
  );

ReactDOM.render(
  list,
  document.getElementById('global')
);
```

We can also add any other HTML attributes here, like `disabled`, `id`, and so on. These props are also used to pass in custom data to our components, but we'll get to that later!
